# RTV Fleet: AI-Powered Fleet Management Dashboard

## Overview
As a Product Manager, I co-led the development of RTV Fleet, an AI-driven dashboard to optimize fleet operations for managers in Nigeria. This project tackled high fuel costs, inefficient routes, and maintenance challenges through a 6-week MVP.

## My Role
- Co-authored the PRD with Rita Famakinwa and Timehin Andrew.
- Defined user personas (Ahmed, Ngozi, Ibrahim) and success metrics (e.g., 15% fuel reduction).
- Guided the roadmap from planning to soft launch with pilot testing.

## Problem Statement
Fleet managers faced high operational costs due to limited data-driven tools for fuel, routes, and maintenance.

## Solution
- **Features**: Sign Up/Profile, Vehicle Management, Fuel Usage, AI Route Suggestions, Maintenance Alerts.
- **Approach**: AI optimization and real-time dashboards.
- **Launch**: 6-week sprint ending in a soft launch.

## User Personas
- **Ahmed**: 42, small logistics owner (5-10 vehicles), seeks automation.
- **Ngozi**: 35, mid-sized fleet manager (20-50 vehicles), wants AI routes.
- **Ibrahim**: 50, bus coordinator (50+ vehicles), needs simple alerts.

## Metrics
- **North Star**: ≥15% fuel cost reduction in 3 months.
- **Activation**: ≥70% AI route adoption.
- **Engagement**: ≤24-hour maintenance alert resolution.

## Roadmap
- Week 1: PRD and planning.
- Week 6: Soft launch with 3-5 pilot users.

## Outcome
Early users reported cost savings and efficiency gains, paving the way for monetization with paid plans.
